# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-with-NLP

# Introduction

This project explores Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze sentiments expressed in tweets. By using the Sentiment140 dataset, we aim to detect whether tweets carry positive or negative sentiments. The project demonstrates key steps from data cleaning and feature extraction to machine learning model training and evaluation for sentiment classification.

# Scope

This project involves:

  - Sentiment classification through Twitter data.
  - Preprocessing text data with techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and TF-IDF for feature extraction.
  - Building a Logistic Regression classifier to categorize tweets.
  - Using Kaggle API for dataset acquisition and Python libraries for analysis.
    
# Requirements
  - Python 3.9 installed on your machine.
  - Necessary libraries like pandas, NumPy, NLTK, scikit-learn, pickle.
  - Kaggle API setup for accessing the Sentiment140 dataset.
    
# Project Structure

  - Data Acquisition: Use the Kaggle API to download the Sentiment140 dataset.
  - Data Cleaning: Remove missing values, duplicates, URLs, and irrelevant elements; standardize text by converting to lowercase.
  - Text Preprocessing: Tokenize text, remove stopwords, and apply stemming to focus on core words.
  - Feature Extraction: Transform text into numerical representations using TF-IDF.
  - Model Training: Build and train a Logistic Regression model to classify tweets as positive or negative.
  - Model Evaluation: Measure model accuracy with evaluation metrics and adjust parameters if necessary.
  - Model Deployment: Save the trained model for future use and deploy it in applications such as web apps or APIs for real-time sentiment analysis.
    
# Installation

  - Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/shubhambhatia2103/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis.git
    
  - Install the required dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
  - Set up Kaggle API for dataset download:
      - Create and download the API token from your Kaggle account.
      - Use the token to download the Sentiment10 dataset as detailed in the instructions.

# Conclusion

This project highlights how NLP can be effectively used to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data, offering insights into public sentiment. The model and methodology provide a solid foundation that can be expanded upon by experimenting with additional models, hyperparameter tuning, or by integrating into a web-based sentiment analysis tool for real-time insights. By working through this project, you will gain hands-on experience with text preprocessing, machine learning models, and the powerful combination of NLP and sentiment analysis.
